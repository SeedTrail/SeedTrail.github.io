            What even are Wikispeedia Voyages?
           </h3>
           <p>
            Let's address the elephant in the room: what exactly are Wikispeedia Voyages? In short, they are defined as a game path where neither the source nor the target is in <b>World Regions</b>, but the path includes at least one article from this category. 
            But that raises another question: how do we identify all the articles that qualify as "World Regions"? 
            The dataset attributes a category to each article in the network - we found out that by combining all the articles with main category "Countries" and a subset of "Geography" subcategories, we obtain an exhaustive set of articles that refer to places, cities, regions or countries.
            The Treemap below shows what articles the new category "World Regions" comprises, as well as its size and sub-structure comparing to all the other categories.
