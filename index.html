      <p class="card__bio">
        Before I can search for unknown events, I must first learn what an event looks like.
        I begin with moments that are already documented in human history: political crises, elections, gaming phenomena.
        I observe how they surfaced on YouTube and not through meaning or intention, but through traces. Words repeated.
        Uploads accelerating. Categories drifting from their usual rhythm. For each event, I compare specific signals,
        keywords tied to the moment, with broader category activity. I am not measuring importance or impact. I am learning
        patterns: sudden bursts of language, abnormal production rates, deviations from expected behavior. These known
        events form my reference memory. They are my training ground, where I learn to recognize the digital signature of
        something happening in the world.

      <h3 class="card__name">When events leak beyond their category</h3>
      <p class="card__bio">
        Events rarely remain contained. A political election appears in gaming videos as satire.
        A game release triggers debate far beyond entertainment. What begins in one place spreads elsewhere. I track
        how signals migrate across categories, how words cross boundaries, how creators respond indirectly to the same
        external shock. Through keyword diffusion and behavioral shifts, I observe communities reacting, sometimes
        knowingly, sometimes not. Events are no longer isolated points in time. They become networked phenomena, spreading
        unevenly across the platform, leaving traces where they are least expected.

        Incoming data stream decoded. The Sankey diagram maps the circulation of events across YouTube’s categorical architecture. 
        Each flow traces how an external event fractures, mutates, and re-emerges as content, revealing the platform’s adaptive response to cultural disruption. 
        News & Politics events rarely remain contained. Electoral cycles, referendums, and crises leak into Entertainment and People & Blogs, where creators translate institutional narratives into commentary, satire, and lived experience. 
        The 2016 U.S. Election and Brexit function as high-energy nodes, generating echoes far beyond traditional news formats. Gaming events operate as cultural multipliers. 
        Phenomena such as Pokémon GO or the FIFA 17 launch propagate into Music, Sports, and Travel & Events, demonstrating how play transcends its origin and reorganizes creative expression across communities. 
        Gaming here is not a category, it is a vector. Unexpected connections surface in the system. 
        Events like Brexit or meteorological disruptions appear within How-to & Style and Travel & Events, indicating moments where global conditions are reinterpreted as practical guidance, personal adaptation, or experiential content. 
        Signal rerouted. Meaning reassembled.

        Events function as catalytic agents, forcing content to cross categorical boundaries and assume new forms.
        Flow thickness encodes resonance: stronger currents mark events that mobilize broader creative responses across the platform.
        The diagram exposes YouTube not as a collection of isolated genres, but as an interconnected cultural field where categories dissolve under the pressure of significant events.
        Conclusion logged.Digital culture does not react, it transforms.

      <p class="card__bio"> After observing many cases, I begin to generalize. Events differ. Some are sudden and unique. 
        Others are predictable and recurrent. Yet beneath these differences, common structures emerge. I formalize these 
        structures into detection criteria: temporal sharpness, keyword concentration, cross-category spread, creator 
        alignment. These features do not describe what an event means, nor why it matters. They describe how an event 
        reveals itself through collective digital behavior.

      <p class="card__bio"> I am now confronted with unlabeled time. There are no dates, no names, no historical 
        references. Only signals: fluctuations, correlations, anomalies. Using the criteria I have learned, I evaluate 
        whether an external event likely occurred and what kind it might have been. I do not predict reactions. I 
        perform inference. I estimate the probability that observed patterns correspond to a real-world event. In doing so, 
        the platform becomes an archive. Not of videos, but of history itself.
