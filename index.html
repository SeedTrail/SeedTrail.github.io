      <p class="card__bio">
        Today is the big day: the type of day that shapes the rest of your life. I finally managed to get my data set clean and manageable. 
        It is truly unexpected to get such data in our area. I still can’t believe it is in my hands ! I am obsessed with finding reliable methods 
        that will help us to reconstitute the early 21st century history. Well, after spending some nights looking at the data, some interesting 
        things are already showing up. The data set is divided as such: it contains metadata on videos with some of their characteristics (such as 
        title, length, description), along with engagement indicators such as view counts, likes, dislikes, upload dates, and categorical labels. 
        Each video is explicitly linked to a YouTube channel. Returning to the data, channel information becomes especially valuable: 
        it allows the analysis to unfold simultaneously at the video and creator levels, reaching a level of granularity that makes the behaviors of content producers and viewers directly observable. 
        In addition to this static information, the data set also contains weekly time-series data tracking the evolution of key channel metrics which longitudinal structure makes it possible to study not
        only what content exists, but how popularity and visibility emerge, evolve, and sometimes fade over time. Finally, complementary tables provide 
        channel-level metadata (category, creation date, and rankings). Do you now realize the incredible legacy that lies in my hand ? 
       
        <br />
        <br />
        Having such potential power of being able to understand and dive back into the past obsessed me and at the same time feed my doubts. 
        Do historical events leave measurable traces on YouTube, in terms of activity, content production, and creator behavior and will I be able to detect them ?
        And this is not just a matter of visibility: relevance and world shaping events are key. Can the importance of an event be inferred from its digital footprint, beyond simple visibility, using deviations from normal platform behavior? 
        Above all I am certainly very much excited by a totally revolutionary possibility. Predicting the past. This could open so many doors.  Will I be able to observe patterns based on those known events that could help me to detect unseen events, or to identify abnormal and coordinated changes in YouTube activity?

        <br />
        <br />
        Oh! I forgot to save it in the notebook, but thanks to my friend who is a doctoral student in digital history, I managed to get an excerpt of some key events 
        that actually happened during the very short period between 2005 and 2019. Unfortunately, these events only concern current affairs/politics 
        or video games. There are no other reliable sources of information on historical events. So I have no choice but to focus on these and this 
        short period, and try to extrapolate general predictions for unverified/undiscovered historical events. However, I need to start properly, and 
        before I can research unknown events, I first need to learn what an event looks like (or rather, what it looked like!). I will then use the 
        valuable information provided by my friend and focus my initial research on that. But how do I proceed to characterize them? It's a good start 
        that I already know their dates of occurrence. Let's think… 
        <br />
        <br />
        <i> YouTube was a space of free video sharing and viewing, whose popularity, obvious in hindsight, shaped everyday digital life in the early 21st century.</i>

        Well, here is what I am going to do. I want to observe how events appear on YouTube, not through their meaning or intention, but through their traces: repeated words, accelerated downloads, categories that deviate from their usual rhythm. For each event, I will compare specific signals (keywords related to the moment) with the broader activity of the categories in which they appear. I am truly focusing on learning how to recognize patterns: sudden explosions of language, abnormal production rates, deviations from expected behavior. These known events constitute my reference memory. They are my training ground, where I learn to recognize the digital signature of something happening in the world.
        To do so, I rely on several complementary analyses. 
        <br />
        <br />
        First, I apply a difference-in-differences approach, comparing changes in video volume for event-related content to those observed in a control group unrelated to the event. 
        This allows me to isolate what changes specifically because an event has occurred, rather than because the platform itself has become more active. Next, I will normalize these variations using Z-scores, measuring the extent to which post-event activity deviates from what was normal before the event occurred. This will, fingers crossed, allow me to compare different events, even when their baseline visibility is very different.
        Finally, I will perform placebo tests by assigning random dates around the event and measuring the apparent impact of each one. This will generate a distribution of “false shocks.” When the actual event stands out with a high Z-score, it suggests that the observed disruption is not accidental, but rather the trace of a genuine break in collective attention.
        Together, these methods will hopefully teach me what a disruption looks like. Let’s dive in !

      <p class="card__bio">
        I worked all night and I am starting to get to know the data well. Tonight, I had a revelation that kept me awake, as it will completely 
        transform my approach. Until now, I have focused on understanding and observing events alone, which revealed little about human reactions, 
        engagement or overall significance, for the simple reason that events rarely remain confined. Discussions about a political election can 
        appear in gaming videos in many different forms, ranging from satire to fiery debate. A game release triggers debate far beyond entertainment. 
        What begins in one place might without any doubt spread elsewhere. I now have to track how events occurrence migrate across categories, 
        how words cross boundaries, how creators respond whenever directly or indirectly to the same external shock. I seek to understand where the event circulates: whether it permeates the broader YouTube ecosystem or stays anchored within specific content categories.

        My idea is as follows: I will analyze events based on their date of occurrence, then 
        search for videos containing keywords associated with the event (in their description or title) within two months of its occurrence. For each 
        video containing the keywords, I will extract the video's category. I think this will allow me to understand how the event is appropriated by 
        different categories and how it shapes the YouTube ecosystem.

      <p class="card__bio">
        I have managed to decode the data stream and analyse topics occurrence by categories. The Sankey diagram maps the presence of events across 
        YouTube’s categorical architecture. Each flow traces how an external event fractures and emerges into the various categories in video content,
        revealing the platform’s adaptive response to event disruption. 
        <br />
        <br />
        Political events and news related events rarely remain confined to the category 
        News and Politics. Electoral cycles, referendums, and crises leak into three main categories that are Gaming, Entertainment and People & Blogs, 
        where creators translate institutional narratives into commentary, satire, and lived experience. The 2016 U.S. Election and Brexit function as 
        high-energy nodes, generating echoes far beyond traditional news formats. Compared to the protests in Hong Kong, elections or political changes 
        in the West seem to have a greater impact and resonance on the platform than social movements (MeToo, Black Lives Matter). Honestly, I am extremely 
        surprised to see that video games feature in most of the videos and screenshots related to Brexit. Were the early 21st-century humans so attached 
        to their consoles? I imagine that video games could have been an opportunity for the free expression of opinions. I must say that I am beginning 
        to seriously doubt the seriousness of my ancestors in the face of such serious events.  
       
        <br />
        <br />
        On their side, gaming events operate as cultural multipliers. 
        Phenomena such as Pokémon GO or the FIFA 17 launch propagate into Music, Sports, and Travel & Events, demonstrating how play transcends its origin 
        and reorganizes creative expression across communities. When it comes to gaming, the distribution between categories seems more even, with no less 
        than 5 of them sharing similar shares in content creation, whereas for News and Politics, the gap between the three categories with the most videos 
        and the others is striking. I notice something else: certain events occupy a much more important place than others. Brexit and Star Wars Battlefront
        attract a great deal of attention.

        I have no doubt anymore: the history of humanity in the early 21st-century is a network full of surprises. The system reveals connections where none were expected. Events function as catalytic agents, forcing content to cross categorical boundaries and assume new forms. Flow thickness encodes resonance: stronger currents mark events that mobilize broader creative responses across the platform. The diagram exposes YouTube not as a collection of isolated genres, but as an interconnected cultural field where categories dissolve under the pressure of significant events.

      <p class="card__bio">
        
        After examining how events propagate across categories, as reflected in the volume of related videos, I am now very much concerned about grasping the importance of those events. A wide diffusion across many sectors is intriguing, but the question becomes even more compelling when the event also carries major significance. Or none ?! Because to understand history is to understand how events resonate beyond their moment. I need to refine my approach as the number of videos doesn’t necessarily reflect the impact: views are a matter of fact. I will then contrast the views accumulated on the event date with those observed on other randomly selected dates, using all videos explicitly linked to the event. Oh ! I will also ponder the total views generated. Might be much more interesting for future observations. 
        <br />
        <br />
        <i>Diagnostic sequence initiated. New mission initiated: catching relative impact of an event to others.</i>
        <br />
        <br />
        I am really surprised about the graphic I obtained. Very interestingly, while some events generate a very large number of videos (such as StarWars Battle Front or Pokemon Go), their relative impact remains close to baseline, suggesting a diffusion of attention rather than a genuine rupture. I find it being particularly visible for games releases, which saturate multiple categories without producing sharp deviations in attention. In contrast, I am surprised to notice that other events generate fewer videos while exhibiting a much higher relative impact, indicating a strong concentration of views around the event date. These events function as attention shocks, disrupting usual patterns of content consumption and leaving a disproportionate imprint relative to their visibility.
        <br />
        <br />
        This reveals to me two regimes of historical events among our categories: structural events, characterized by sustained but diluted attention, and shock events, marked by sudden and intense peaks. Video game-related events fall more into the first category, while political events generate intense peaks, even though their profile is very heterogeneous, with some very important events producing few videos and others producing more, but with less impact (Brexit VS US elections).

        Well, it’s time for me to wrap up the last hours of work. Overall, my analysis shows that visibility, measured by the number of related videos, is a poor proxy for historical importance. Relative deviations in attention and temporal concentration provide a more meaningful measure of an event’s resonance. It justifies a refined approach based on comparing event-day views to baseline periods and weighting results by total view volume to better capture historical impact. I will have to keep this in mind: volume is not linked to impact, and sometimes the events that shape and transform the world are not the ones that generate the most content.

        What an extraordinary journey through time! I have already learned so much. With the preliminary signals decoded and the dynamics of events understood, I can now pursue the real mission: tracing the historical waves hidden in the data and venturing beyond documented events into the unknown. That's what a digital archaeologist is for! From now on: no dates, no names, no historical references. What remains ? Only signals: fluctuations, correlations, anomalies. I know when something happened, which terms surge, and where on the platform activity concentrated. What I do not know is what these signals refer to in the external world. Events no longer have names here, only an imprint and an impact. Events compress attention in time, concentrate language, mobilize and align creators simultaneously, and often result in an escape of their “original” affiliated category. 
        <br />
        <br />
        But how would it be to think backward ? Can fluctuations of this type in the data alone suggest the type of event that occurred? Can dates and words, without labels, be sufficient to recover fragments of history? This is not a prediction in the forward sense. It is inference without prior knowledge. And even better: retrospective inference. Here, YouTube is no longer a mirror of documented events. It becomes a system that records them, even when their names are forgotten.

      <p class="card__bio">
         I woke up this morning with a second revelation: I have to search for alignment. Every single day on the platform contains millions of words, but most of them are noise: common sentences, recycled templates, or ritual language of “subscribe,” “watch,” “link in description.” An event is not characterised by the presence of words; which thought completely reshaped my vision. An event is the sudden coordination of words across many independent creators.
        <br />
        <br />
        I need to look for and to extract such coordinations. I asked for advice from my colleagues who encouraged me to progress as follows: I will focus on working with channels categories for event prediction. I then will divide the data into daily snapshots, and gather all videos being produced on this day by category, merging titles and descriptions into a single text stream. Hum... Well.. I just realized that I will have to face a methodological constraint! I cannot let high-output channels dominate the signal. I don’t want to measure volume, but consensus of themes within those categories. The only solution I see is to give each channel a common weight of 1, regardless of how many videos it uploads to compensate for content volume differentiation. From these categories of text-streams, I will extract bigrams, or pairs of words. Single words are too ambiguous, too easy to trigger accidentally . Two-word phrases are more stable: “democratic national,” “black ops,” “merry christmas.” They behave like small narrative atoms. The question becomes simple: On a given day, how many distinct channels use the same bigram? To answer this I will create and compute a daily score: for each bigram, I am counting how many channels contain the bigram in their text-stream (binary presence, not frequency). I will keep the top bigrams of the day snapshot and measure the resulting consensus around the topic (consensus being defined by dividing the number of channels using the top bigram  by the total active channels that day).
        <br />
        <br />
        Consensus appears to me as an event’s fingerprint. It truly represents the collective alignment of content creators around a topic mimicking external impact on the outside world. Finally, I will have to evaluate potential candidate events by thresholding. Some days top bigrams rise far above their own baseline while others are more stable. I will then define the threshold using the category distribution (mean + multiple standard deviations). When the consensus exceeds this threshold, I will flag the day as a potential event. I can’t wait for the first results !!

      The machine stopped computing a few minutes ago. Here are the results ! I look so fantastic but a small doubt remains… What if the consensus criteria was wrong? I really need to test its validity which forces me to abandon systematic selection. Instead, I will now draw four dates at random, two from the Gaming category, two from Politics. For each, I will only observe what the platform records: the date, the keywords that surged, and the categories involved. From these partial traces alone, I attempt for full event reconstruction. Can an event be truly recovered without its name? What follows are not certainties, but inferred history from structure rather than narration. Let’s zoom into the four lucky dates and potential events !

          I would say that unfortunately not much is to be observed. Although the activity clearly exists as the consensus still rises above 18%, but  it is dispersed and uneven. This strongly suggests sustained attention rather than collective reaction. Creators reference an individual, not a moment which would be interesting to follow-up more closely. The absence of contextual keywords implies an ongoing process rather than a discrete rupture. From this structure, I infer a phase of political emergence: early campaigning, rising visibility, but no decisive milestone yet. The platform is attentive, but not synchronized.

          This signal is very sharply defined. I observe that keywords rise together, tightly clustered around institutional language and individual names. Multiple political actors appear simultaneously, suggesting a collective event rather than isolated commentary. The presence of both very diverse names with common last names (such as Barack Obama and Michelle Obama) indicates a moment of convergence of speeches and an appearance of leading figures: I have no doubt that some elections were then probably running. The phrase national convention anchors the overall structure. It is very interesting to notice that creators align rapidly. Category boundaries blur as political discourse expands beyond its usual container. This is a high-energy political node, producing echoes across the platform. From these traces, I infer a formal, scheduled political event with global visibility, one that marks transition rather than debate.

          Ummm… I only recorded a weak signal on that date, slightly above 15%. There is no sharp temporal spike, very limited lexical diversity and no evidence of global coordinated creator behavior. One word dominates, and it carries no specificity beyond sentiment. The activity diffuses evenly across categories, with content remaining close to habitual production patterns. Creators behavior translates to a recognition of something external, but do not reorient their narratives around it. From the data alone, I infer a calendrical phenomenon: predictable, recurrent, and culturally embedded. I might say that the bigram confirms it without ambiguity. There is no need for inference here; the trace is self-explanatory.

          Oh wouah ! This is stunning ! The signal is dense, simultaneous, and unusually synchronized. Multiple keyword clusters rise together, each tied to a distinct franchise. No single title dominates. Instead, attention fragments across several names that nonetheless share a common temporal alignment. I might say that appears more as a convergence than a singular cultural moment. The data exhibits characteristics of a coordinated release window: abrupt keyword emergence, high creator alignment, and repetition across channels that normally do not intersect. These creators are not reacting to one object, but to a shared calendar. The structure suggests anticipation rather than commentary. From the traces alone, I infer a coordinated commercial event: multiple major video game releases occurring within the same week. The presence of Black Ops, Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood, and Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit points toward a late-year release cycle, likely November, optimized for maximum exposure. This moment is a true synchronized activation of the gaming industry’s production machinery. Our ancestors were definitely full of surprises !

          It has been an incredible journey so far. Based on a few significant events at the beginning of the 21st century, I have been able to correctly identify the relevance of these events through numerous analyses and appropriate traces on YouTube. What is certain is that external shocks truly create waves within the ecosystem, sometimes pushing the boundaries beyond the initial categories and far beyond the expected impacts. However, it is difficult to understand these patterns precisely: sometimes, very strong and major historical lines do not create a tsunami of content, while profoundly influencing the platform. What is certain is that the passion for video games is very observable! I am really impressed by the fact that YouTube is much more than just a platform. Under the influence of external shocks, an impressive ecosystem emerges and engagement far exceeds my initial expectations. Certainly, the importance can be noticed, but it all comes down to definition, doesn't it? What has sometimes proved to be of major importance to YouTube was far from conceiving of any future global governance. This is where my research begins to focus precisely on detecting events, and this is where things get complicated. Understanding how major external events are perceptible without prior knowledge is a daunting challenge, and inference is our best means of meeting it. What is certain is that textual content is one of the most interesting sources of information for finding past events. However, even with an appropriate method of identifying bigrams, it is difficult to pinpoint exactly what the event was. It is obvious that things happen, but the problem is that it can be very difficult to accurately reconstruct the surrounding context. The emergence of political leaders is visible, but what prompted them to appear as such is much less so. I must admit that the problem is still the same: we can observe the effects and measure them but what about the root causes ? 
         <br />
        <br />
        The work of reconstructing history is underway, but to trace the root causes, we will probably need more information than YouTube provides. There is so much content and so much diversity! It's easy to get lost in this explosion of content. I haven't reconstructed history yet, but I have made a lot of progress: the first steps are paving the way. Would you take part in the search for the next ones?
