      <p class="card__bio">
        Today is the big day: the type of day that shapes the rest of you whole life. I finally managed to get my data set clean and manageable. 
        It is truly unexpected to get such data in our area. I still can’t believe it is in my hands ! I am obsessed with finding reliable methods 
        that will help us to reconstitute the early 21st century history. Well, after spending some nights looking to the data some interesting 
        things are already showing up: the data set is divided as such: it contains metadata on videos with some of their characteristics (such as 
        title, length, description), along with engagement indicators such as view counts, likes, dislikes, upload dates, and categorical labels. 
        Each video is explicitly linked to a YouTube channel. A channel for our contemporary future listeners was curiosity of former times where 
        some people had special accounts thanks to which they were posting videos on the platform.*Coming back to the data, the channel's information 
        is particularly useful as it will allow me to analyze the data both at the video level and at the creator level reaching an incredible level 
        of granularity: what better than understanding behaviors of content producers and viewers ? In addition to this static information, the dataset
        also contains weekly time-series data tracking the evolution of key channel metrics which longitudinal structure makes it possible to study not
        only what content exists, but how popularity and visibility emerge, evolve, and sometimes fade over time. Finally, complementary tables provide 
        channel-level metadata (category, creation date, and rankings). Do you now realize the incredible legacy that lies in my hand ? 
       <br />
        Oh! I forgot to 
        save it in the notebook, but thanks to my friend who is a doctoral student in digital history, I managed to get an excerpt of some key events 
        that actually happened during the very short period between 2012 and 2019. Unfortunately, these events only concern current affairs/politics 
        or video games. There are no other reliable sources of information on historical events. So I have no choice but to focus on these and this 
        short period, and try to extrapolate general predictions for unverified/undiscovered historical events. However, I need to start properly, and 
        before I can research unknown events, I first need to learn what an event looks like (or rather, what it looked like!). I will then use the 
        valuable information provided by my friend and focus my initial research on that. But how do I proceed to characterize them? It's a good start 
        that I already know their dates of occurrence. Let's think… 
        <br />
        Okay here is what I am gonna do: I will observe how they surfaced on YouTube and not 
        through meaning or intention, but through traces. Words repeated. Uploads accelerating. Categories drifting from their usual rhythm. For each event
        , I will compare specific signals, keywords tied to the moment, with broader category activity. I am not measuring importance or impact. I am 
        learning patterns: sudden bursts of language, abnormal production rates, deviations from expected behavior. These known events form my reference 
        memory. They are my training ground, where I learn to recognize the digital signature of something happening in the world.

      <h3 class="card__name">When events leak beyond their category</h3>
      <p class="card__bio">
        I worked all night and am starting to get to know the data well. Tonight, I had a revelation that kept me awake, as it will completely 
        transform my approach. Until now, I have focused on understanding and observing events alone, which revealed little about human reactions, 
        engagement or overall significance, for the simple reason that events rarely remain confined. Discussions about a political election can 
        appear in gaming videos in many different forms, ranging from satire to fiery debate. A game release triggers debate far beyond entertainment. 
        What begins in one place might without any doubt spread elsewhere. I now have to track how events occurrence migrate across categories, 
        how words cross boundaries, how creators respond whenever directly or indirectly to the same external shock. I want to determine in which 
        categories the event is being discussed: is it an important event that is spreading widely throughout the YouTube ecosystem, or is it limited 
        to certain specific categories of content creators?  
        <br/>
        My idea is as follows: I will analyze events based on their date of occurrence, then 
        search for videos containing keywords associated with the event (in their description or title) within two months of its occurrence. For each 
        video containing the keywords, I will extract the video's category. I think this will allow me to understand how the event is appropriated by 
        different categories and how it shapes the YouTube ecosystem. <br />

      <p class="card__bio">
        I have managed to decode the data stream and analyse topics occurrence by categories. The Sankey diagram maps the presence of events across 
        YouTube’s categorical architecture. Each flow traces how an external event fractures and emerges into the various categories in video content,
        revealing the platform’s adaptive response to event disruption. Political events and news related events rarely remain confined to the category 
        News and Politics. Electoral cycles, referendums, and crises leak into three main categories that are Gaming, Entertainment and People & Blogs, 
        where creators translate institutional narratives into commentary, satire, and lived experience. The 2016 U.S. Election and Brexit function as 
        high-energy nodes, generating echoes far beyond traditional news formats. Compared to the protests in Hong Kong, elections or political changes 
        in the West seem to have a greater impact and resonance on the platform than social movements (MeToo, Black Lives Matter). Honestly, I am extremely 
        surprised to see that video games feature in most of the videos and screenshots related to Brexit. Were the early 21st-century humans so attached 
        to their consoles? I imagine that video games could have been an opportunity for the free expression of opinions. I must say that I am beginning 
        to seriously doubt the seriousness of my ancestors in the face of such serious events.  <br />
        On their side, gaming events operate as cultural multipliers. 
        Phenomena such as Pokémon GO or the FIFA 17 launch propagate into Music, Sports, and Travel & Events, demonstrating how play transcends its origin 
        and reorganizes creative expression across communities. When it comes to gaming, the distribution between categories seems more even, with no less 
        than 5 of them sharing similar shares in content creation, whereas for News and Politics, the gap between the three categories with the most videos 
        and the others is striking. I notice something else: certain events occupy a much more important place than others. Brexit and Star Wars Battlefront
        attract a great deal of attention. <br />

        Time is no longer unlabeled. Dates remain. Words remain. Categories remain.
        What is missing is attribution. I know when something happened, which terms surged, and where on the platform activity concentrated. 
        What I do not know is what these signals refer to in the external world. The event itself has no name here, only a footprint. 
        From earlier sections, I have learned how events manifest digitally. They compress attention in time, concentrate language, mobilize many creators simultaneously, and often escape their original category. 
        These recurring patterns form detection criteria. They do not explain meaning or causality. They describe how collective behavior reorganizes in response to something outside the platform. 
        In this section, I apply these criteria to moments whose real-world referent is unknown. The timeline becomes interactive: each anomaly marks a potential event. 
        When selected, it reveals its internal structure, keywords that rose together, categories that reacted, creators that aligned, without revealing why. Only after detection do I allow interpretation. 
        I select several of these signals and attempt retrospective inference: can the platform’s traces alone suggest what kind of event occurred? Can dates and words, without labels, be sufficient to recover fragments of history? 
        This is not prediction in the forward sense. It is inference without prior knowledge. Here, YouTube is no longer a mirror of documented events. It becomes a system that records them, even when their names are forgotten.

        To test the validity of these criteria, I abandon systematic selection. Instead, I draw four dates at random, two from the Gaming category, two from Politics. For each, I observe only what the platform records: the date, the keywords that surged, and the categories involved. From these partial traces alone, I attempt reconstruction. Each case becomes an experiment in inference: can an event be recovered without its name? Can collective digital behavior, observed retrospectively, be sufficient to predict what occurred in the world beyond the platform? What follows are not certainties, but hypotheses, history inferred from structure rather than narration.

        The signal is weak, but stable. There is no sharp temporal spike, no lexical diversity, no evidence of coordinated creator behavior. One word dominates, and it carries no specificity beyond sentiment.The platform does not reorganize itself around this moment. Instead, activity diffuses evenly across categories, with content remaining close to habitual production patterns. Creators acknowledge something external, but do not reorient their narratives around it. This is not an event that demands explanation. It is a pause. From the data alone, I infer a calendrical phenomenon: predictable, recurrent, and culturally embedded. The keyword confirms it without ambiguity. There is no need for inference here; the trace is self-explanatory. <strong> History reconstructed: Christmas Eve. </strong> The platform breathes, but it does not react.

        This signal is sharply defined. Keywords rise together, tightly clustered around institutional language and named individuals. Multiple political actors appear simultaneously, suggesting a collective event rather than isolated commentary.The presence of both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton indicates a moment of convergence rather than competition. Michelle Obama’s inclusion shifts the signal toward ceremonial speech rather than electoral strategy. The phrase national convention anchors the structure. Creators align rapidly. Category boundaries blur as political discourse expands beyond its usual container. This is a high-energy political node, producing echoes across the platform. From these traces, I infer a formal, scheduled political event with global visibility, one that marks transition rather than debate. <strong> History reconstructed: the 2008 Democratic National Convention, during Barack Obama’s presidential campaign. </strong> The platform records not the speeches themselves, but the collective recognition that something decisive is unfolding.

        The signal is dense, simultaneous, and unusually synchronized. Multiple keyword clusters rise together, each tied to a distinct franchise. No single title dominates. Instead, attention fragments across several names that nonetheless share a common temporal alignment. This is not a singular cultural moment. It is a convergence. The platform exhibits characteristics of a coordinated release window: abrupt keyword emergence, high creator alignment, and repetition across channels that normally do not intersect. These creators are not reacting to one object, but to a shared calendar. The structure suggests anticipation rather than commentary. From the traces alone, I infer a coordinated commercial event: multiple major video game releases occurring within the same week. The presence of Black Ops, Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood, and Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit points toward a late-year release cycle, likely November, optimized for maximum exposure.
        This moment is not an event in the political sense. It is a ritual.
         A synchronized activation of the gaming industry’s production machinery.

        Here, the signal is narrow. One name dominates. There is no institutional framing, no secondary figures, no event-specific vocabulary. Activity exists, but it is dispersed and uneven. This suggests sustained attention rather than collective reaction. Creators reference an individual, not a moment. The absence of contextual keywords implies an ongoing process rather than a discrete rupture. From this structure, I infer a phase of political emergence: early campaigning, rising visibility, but no decisive milestone yet. The platform is attentive, but not synchronized. <strong> History reconstructed: the early stages of the 2008 U.S. presidential primary season, before consolidation around a single defining event. </strong> This is not history crystallized.  It is history still forming.
