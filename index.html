    <h2>The Story of HTML</h2>
    <h3>A brief introduction</h3>
    <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard[dubious – discuss] markup language[a] for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. 
      It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
      Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>

    <h2>Diving into history</h2>
    <h3>Founders biography</h3>
    <p>Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. 
      It was formally defined as such by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification, the "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which included an SGML Document type definition to define the syntax.[10][11] 
      The draft expired after six months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images, reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested standardizing already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.[12]
      After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working Group. In 1995, this working group completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a standard against which future implementations should be based.[13]</p>
